# Angular Task

The app called Shopping cart app.
We provide a few components to build a simple shop with a cart system.
The main goal is to fix a few issues across comonents and implement add and remove products to you cart.

## Your Task

This is a TDD (test driven development) task. 
Your task is to fix a few issues across the app and to add few features and pass the tests. 
It may look scary at first but carry on!

### 1. Products List Component
- Some products do not have a proper template rendering to fix it, consider the following:
    * Make sure the 'default' template is used if the product type has no template provided.
    * If a custom 'default' template is provided, make sure it overrides the 'default' template of the component. 

### 2. Cart Service
- At first, the view only updates when the user interacts with it, to fix this consider the following:
    * Make sure cartState is emiting updates upon subscribing.
    * There are some items already added in the cart. Make sure to display them when open the page
- Implement addProduct, consider the following rules:
    * _cardState should to be updated.
    * Product should be pushed to items Array inside _products.
    * If adding a product that is already in the cart, the product amount should increase instead of adding a new record.
    * Product subtotal should be calculated based of the product amount.
        * EX: PRODUCT_A -> Price: 500 -> Amount: 2 -> Subtotal should be 1000
        * subtotal = price * amount (see calculateSubtotal method already implemented)
     * Cart total price should be calculated based of the subtotals.
        * EX: PRODUCT_A -> Subtotal 1000 + PRODUCT_B -> Subtotal: 750 -> Total price should be 1750.
        * total = sum of all subtotals (see calculateTotal method already implemented) 
- Implement removeProduct, consider the following rules:
    * _cardState should be updated.
    * Product should be removed from items Array inside _products.
    * If removing a product that was added more than once, the product amount should decrease instead of removing the whole.
    * Subtotal and total should be re-calculated accordingly.

### 3. Cart item control 
- Has a potential memory leak.
- Sorting and filtering products leave dangling subscriptions in cart control component.
- Make sure components unsubscribe when they get destroyed. (You can also use async pipe)

### 4. CSS Theming
- The application is using the bootstrap classes, however they are not being applied.
    * Configure the application to use the bootstrap CSS.
- There is a prototipe in the root of the project. The application should be styled as in the image, using boostrap classes or css created by you.

### 5. [BONUS] Unit tests
- The application has some unit tests to help you checkout if everything is working correctly. There are also unit tests which are broken
    * Make sure the unit tests are passing and working correctly

Follow the steps above to achieve completion! Feel free to use any of the angular features.
New features in the app are welcome and appreciated.

## If you downloaded the project, make sure to delete node_modules before zipping and uploading it back.

# Setup

1. `npm install` to get dependencies
2. Start app with `npm run start` and point webbrowser to `http://localhost:4200/`
3. Use `npm run test:watch` to see tests failing
4. Fix issues so that tests pass
5. Solve all issues mentioned here
6. Submit your code on Devskiller platform to see if task is completed

# Good Luck!
